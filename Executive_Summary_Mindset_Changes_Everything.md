## TL;DR

**Mindset is the single biggest lever for improving performance.** Research shows:
- Fair & accurate informal feedback → **+39.1% performance**
- Risk-taking/experimentation → **+38.9% performance**

The core shift: move from a **fixed mindset** (proving yourself) to a **growth mindset** (improving yourself).

**Your job is NOT to prove yourself—it's to IMPROVE yourself.**

## The Success Formula

```
Beliefs → Behaviors → Outcomes
```

**Mindset** = Your beliefs about how the world works (especially how people work) that shape your behaviors and determine your outcomes.

## Why Mindset Matters NOW

| Driver | Reality |
|--------|---------|
| **Performance** | Growth mindset cultures significantly outperform fixed mindset cultures |
| **Uncertainty** | "I have never seen such consistency around one pain point as uncertainty." |
| **AI/Disruption** | "This is as normal and recognizable as the world will ever look again." |

### The 211 Degrees Problem
Everyone's operating at 211°F all the time. Water boils at 212°F. It only takes a degree to tip into boiling—people get so angry, offended, frustrated, and afraid so quickly.

## Fixed vs. Growth Mindset

### Fixed Mindset (Less Helpful)
**Core Belief:** Intelligence and skills are inherent traits. You either have them, or you don't.

**Your Job:** PROVE yourself

| # | Behavior | Description |
|---|----------|-------------|
| 1 | Look Smart | Intense desire to prove you're right, all the time, about everything |
| 2 | Avoid Challenges | "Stay in your box with your cards" |
| 3 | Give Up Easily | "Quitting is way better than failing" |
| 4 | Disdain Effort | "Effort is for people who aren't good at stuff" |
| 5 | Fear Feedback | Terrified of hearing "you're not enough" |
| 6 | Resent Others | If you have more, I have less (scarcity mindset) |

**Outcome:** Plateau. "So busy proving how awesome I already am, I never find out how awesome I actually could be."

---

### Growth Mindset (More Helpful)
**Core Belief:** Intelligence and skills are largely the result of learning and effort.

**Your Job:** IMPROVE yourself

| # | Behavior | Description |
|---|----------|-------------|
| 1 | Desire to Learn | Do whatever it takes to get better |
| 2 | Love Challenges | "I can do anything until proven otherwise" |
| 3 | Keep Trying | "Fail better each time in pursuit of awesome" |
| 4 | Embrace Effort | "Full preparation, full effort—left it on the field" |
| 5 | Leverage Feedback | "It's like cheating in the best possible sense" |
| 6 | Inspired by Others | Learning from others' success (abundance mindset) |

**Outcome:** Continuous growth toward full potential.

## Three Levers of Mindset Shift

### Lever 1: Education (Most Important)
Teach people about growth mindset. When people understand what mindset is and how it works, they often start shifting on their own.

### Lever 2: Feedback (+39.1% Performance)
Fair and accurate informal feedback is the #1 driver of discretionary effort. Create psychological safety to give and receive honest feedback.

**Key Practice:** Complete the Feedback Preferences exercise with your team—learn how each person prefers to receive feedback.

### Lever 3: Experimentation (+38.9% Performance)
Risk-taking and experimentation drive breakthrough results. Create safe-to-fail environments where appropriate failure is celebrated.

**Key Quote:** "If you never fail, you're not pushing yourself."
